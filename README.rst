GraphQuest
==========

GraphQuest is a small Python library for creating graph theory question generators.
It is intended to be used in conjunction with the GraphQuest website,
where teachers can upload their question generators and build topics (i.e. quizzes) from them.

This library contains the following modules:

* `graph.py <https://github.com/PaoloMura/graphquest/blob/main/src/graphquest/graph.py>`_
    A module that provides additional features on top of networkx.
* `question.py <https://github.com/PaoloMura/graphquest/blob/main/src/graphquest/question.py>`_
    A module that contains all the question types that you can extend.
